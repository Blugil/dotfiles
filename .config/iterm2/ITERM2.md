# Iterm2

## Dependencies

- MesloLGS NF font
- None other (that I know of)

## Setup

Iterm2 deserves it's own readme, because it's quite customized. To mimic my exact setup there are a few seteps to take:

1. Navigate to iterm2 preferences and click on `Profiles`.

2. Download the iterm2-gruvbox.json from this directory in the git repo.

3. Click on the `other actions` drop down and select `import JSON profiles`

4. Select the json file you downloaded.

Now that you've got the profile I use installed, let's do the nitty gritty.

1. Using the search bar on the top right, search for `scrollbar` until the option `hide scrollbars` shows up then click it.

2. Using the search bar again, search for `margins` until you can click on either `side` or `top & bottom` margins. Both of mine of are to `20px`, it's just what I like.

BAM, you're done! So long as you have powerline10k installed, you should have a fully replicated iterm2 setup!
